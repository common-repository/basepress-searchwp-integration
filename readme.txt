BasePress is the best option when it comes to building single or multiple knowledge bases on your WordPress site.
If you want to use SearchWP to power your BasePress searches this add-on is what you are looking for!
For this add-on to work you need a copy of [SearchWP](https://searchwp.com/) and [BasePress Premium](https://codesavory.com/) 2.6.8 or above.


= Why is this plugin necessary? =
BasePress was developed with a search feature of its own which filters the results according to the Knowledge Base visited, by language when used wth WPML and by BasePress content restrictions.
This add-on makes it possible to use SearchWP to power the knowledge base searches and retain the automatic filtering of the content.
It also integrates SearchWP with BasePress Live results.

4. Add the "Knowledge Base" post type to the engine.
5. Set up your engine as needed.
6. Save SearchWP engine settings.

Once SearchWP index is fully built, searches in your knowledge base will be run by SearchWP.
